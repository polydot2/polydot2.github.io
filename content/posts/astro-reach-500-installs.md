#### Today is a good day !

Astro the tarot readings app has reached 500 installs **\o/**

First version of the app was release mid november 2022 as an mvp. The app was only a pretty basic horoscope with no Tarot features.

Only 12 zodiac signs with a daily horoscope. 

<br>

### Iteration loop

During late december and January we added tarot feature with only the daily card, then late January was added multiples Tarot reading, share feature and all minors arcana.

### Today and future plans

So today we reach 500 installs and it's a very good milestone !

For next steps, we will focus on new readings and maybe an history feature for record all readings and dilay card, get some stats from it ect..

We also consider to add light accounts that can be used to share daily cards across friends and maybe add some gamifications.

Final words is thank you very much <3

**Stay tune for future updates !**
