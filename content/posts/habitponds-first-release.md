#### Great news ! 

Today we release our new projects aka Habits pond.

A simple tracking habit app with daily reward and cute frogs to collect !

The idea is not very innovative but we wanted to experiment with notifications and add some gamifictions features to stay motivated.

Tracking habits and fight procrastination is a major problem that many people have, including me..

We weren't very satisfied with other habit app we tried so why not build our own.

#### Track, earn, unlock

#### Longterm development
Like our previous app, we plan to add new features and fixes every month until we reach full potential.

For now we only release on Android, but iOS version will be coming soon !
