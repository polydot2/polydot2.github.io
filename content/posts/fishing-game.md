#### A new project ?

During late March and April we worked on some prototypes and gameplay loop tests.

The main goal was to release another project on April, an app game oriented intead of a tool. 

Some idea was good on paper but not very fun when we implemented it, so production phase never happened during this month.

Current project is currently not fun at all and the question is : finish and release or drop and cancel ?
