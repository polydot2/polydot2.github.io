  <h2>Terms &amp; Conditions</h2> <p>
                  By downloading or using any of our apps, these terms will
                  automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
                  that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re
                  not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app,
                  or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt
                  to extract the source code of the app, and you also
                  shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or
                  make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade
                  marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual
                  property rights related to it, still belong to
                  Polydot.
                </p> <p>
                  Polydot is committed to ensuring that the app
                  is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
                  reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge
                  for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will
                  never charge you for the app or its services without making
                  it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
                </p> <p>
                  The app stores and processes personal data
                  that you have provided to us, in order to provide
                  our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your
                  phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend
                  that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the
                  process of removing software restrictions and limitations
                  imposed by the official operating system of your device. It
                  could make your phone vulnerable to
                  malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s
                  security features and it could mean that the
                  app won’t work properly or at all.
                </p> <p>
                  You should be aware that there are certain things that
                  Polydot will not take responsibility for.
                  Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an
                  active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or
                  provided by your mobile network provider, but
                  Polydot cannot take responsibility for the
                  app not working at full functionality if you don’t have
                  access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data
                  allowance left.
                </p> <p></p> <p>
                  If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
                  should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
                  mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you
                  may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data
                  for the duration of the connection while accessing the app,
                  or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re
                  accepting responsibility for any such charges, including
                  roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home
                  territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data
                  roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on
                  which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume
                  that you have received permission from the bill payer for
                  using the app.
                </p> <p>
                  Along the same lines, Polydot cannot always
                  take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You
                  need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it
                  runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the
                  Service, Polydot cannot accept
                  responsibility.
                </p> <p>
                  With respect to Polydot’s responsibility for
                  your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s
                  important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to
                  ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do
                  rely on third parties to provide information to us so that
                  we can make it available to you.
                  Polydot accepts no liability for any loss,
                  direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying
                  wholly on this functionality of the app.
                </p> <p>
                  At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
                  currently available on Android &amp; iOS – the requirements for
                  both systems (and for any additional systems we
                  decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
                  and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
                  using the app. Polydot does not promise that
                  it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
                  and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have
                  installed on your device. However, you promise to always
                  accept updates to the application when offered to you, We
                  may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate
                  use of it at any time without giving notice of termination
                  to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination,
                  (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms
                  will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed)
                  delete it from your device.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Payment Terms</strong></p>
                <p><strong>IN-APP PURCHASES</strong> - Polydot may license to you certain virtual goods to be used within the Apps and which you may purchase with real cash or which you may earn or redeem via gameplay (“Virtual Items”). When you obtain such Virtual Items from Polydot or its authorized designee, you receive a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable and revocable license to use such Virtual Items within the applicable App and solely for non-commercial use.<br>

Polydot may manage, control, modify or eliminate Virtual Items at any time, with or without notice. Without limiting the foregoing, Polydot reserves the right at any time to impose additional terms or conditions on your use of Virtual Items. Such additional terms and conditions will be effective immediately and incorporated into this Agreement. Your continued use of the App will be deemed acceptance thereof. The transfer of Virtual Items is prohibited, except where expressly authorized in the Apps, if any.

Virtual Items have no monetary value and are not currency or property. Virtual Items do not have an equivalent value in real cash and do not act as a substitute for real world money. Virtual Items cannot be sold, traded, transferred, or exchanged for cash. Virtual Items may only be redeemed for certain gameplay entitlements that may be made available within the App from time to time. Neither Polydot nor any other person or entity has any obligation to exchange Virtual Items for anything of value. Polydot has no liability for hacking or loss of your Virtual Items.

Price and availability of Virtual Items are subject to change without notice.

Unless otherwise required by law, all purchases and redemptions of Virtual Items made through the App or Services are final and non-refundable, and you are not entitled to a refund for any unused Virtual Items. Once you redeem a Virtual Item for a gameplay entitlement within the App or Services, such gameplay entitlement is not returnable, exchangeable, or refundable. You acknowledge and consent that the provision of Virtual Items for use in connection with the App or Services is a process that commences immediately upon purchase and you forfeit your right of withdrawal once the performance has started.

Unless otherwise required by law, you agree that Polydot is not required to provide a refund for Virtual Items for any reason, and that you will not receive money or other compensation for unused Virtual Items, whether your loss of license under this Agreement was voluntary or involuntary.
</p>
<p><strong>SUBSCRIPTIONS</strong> - Some of Polydot's Apps may offer subscription-based Services. If you purchase a subscription, then by clicking the purchase button you are requesting that we begin supplying the subscription Services immediately and you are entering into a monthly subscription contract with Polydot. You are also authorizing a charge to you on a recurring basis of a monthly subscription fee at the rate quoted at the time of purchase. &nbsp;By purchasing a subscription, we will automatically charge on a recurring basis the payment method associated with your account. For subscription Services purchased in a Polydot App played on a platform such as Apple or Google, the applicable platform will charge you for the subscription fee and the platform’s payment terms will apply. Please review the appropriate platform’s payment terms for additional information.

Trial subscriptions are offered free of charge for a certain period of time from activation specified in the relevant trial offer in the App. If you do not cancel the subscription within such trial period, the trial subscription will automatically convert into a paid subscription for the fees and for the subscription period set out in the App at the time of the activation of the trial period. You may cancel a subscription during its free trial period using the subscription setting of your account. Any paid subscription you activate begins immediately from the activation of such paid subscription and not after the expiration of any trial period. Any unused trial period will therefore be forfeited if a subscription is activated prior to the expiration of such trial period.

Your subscription will automatically renew each subscription period unless and until you terminate your subscription or we terminate it.&nbsp;You must cancel your subscription before it renews, otherwise payment of the subscription fees for the next period will be taken automatically via your chosen payment method. You are responsible for the timely payment of all fees and for providing Polydot with valid credit card or payment account details for payment of all fees. In case the subscription fee cannot be taken from your account due to absence of monetary funds, invalidity of credit card or for any other reason, your subscription will be automatically cancelled.

Subscription rates are based on an amount in U.S. Dollars. If you are using a local currency, the actual amount may fluctuate based on currency exchange rates without notice to you. The charges will be applied to the payment instrument or method you provide when you start your subscription (or to a different payment instrument or method, if you change your account information). Please note that prices and charges are subject to change. If we make a change to the monthly subscription rate in U.S. Dollars, we will notify you of such change in advance.

Once you have purchased a subscription, you cannot cancel your subscription for the current subscription period as that is activated as soon as you purchase a subscription. However, you may cancel your subscription for the next subscription period as follows: you can manage and cancel your subscription at any time in your “Account Settings” of your device. For iOS subscriptions, please see Apple’s support page https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202039. For Google Play subscriptions, please see Google Play’s support page https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7018481.

Except where required by applicable law, paid subscription fees are non-refundable.

Polydot in its sole discretion and at any time may modify the subscription fee. Any subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current subscription period. You will be provided reasonable prior notice of any change in subscription fee. If you do not take action to agree to the increase in subscription fee, your subscription shall expire at the end of the then-current subscription period.
